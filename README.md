# PRODIGY_CS_02

The Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption project is designed to explore advanced techniques in digital image processing and cryptography. This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how pixel manipulation can be used to encrypt and secure digital images, ensuring that sensitive visual data is protected from unauthorized access.

# Project Objectives:
Understand Image Processing Basics: Gain foundational knowledge of digital image processing and the role of pixels in representing images.
Learn Encryption Principles: Explore fundamental cryptographic concepts and how they can be applied to digital images.
Implement Pixel Manipulation Algorithms: Develop algorithms that alter pixel values to encrypt and decrypt images.
Analyze Security: Evaluate the effectiveness of pixel manipulation techniques in protecting image data and understand their strengths and weaknesses.
Create Practical Applications: Apply pixel manipulation for image encryption in real-world scenarios, such as secure image transmission and storage.
# Project Components:
Introduction to Image Processing: Study how images are represented digitally, focusing on pixel grids and color models (e.g., RGB).
Cryptographic Concepts: Learn about basic cryptographic techniques and how they can be adapted for image data, including key management and encryption schemes.
Algorithm Design: Write pseudocode and implement pixel manipulation algorithms to encrypt and decrypt images. Techniques may include pixel substitution, permutation, and more complex transformations.
User Interface: Design a simple user interface (command-line or graphical) that allows users to upload images, encrypt them, and decrypt them back to their original form.
Security Analysis: Discuss the security aspects of pixel-based image encryption, including resistance to attacks and potential vulnerabilities.
Performance Evaluation: Assess the performance of the encryption and decryption processes in terms of speed, quality, and robustness against various attacks.
